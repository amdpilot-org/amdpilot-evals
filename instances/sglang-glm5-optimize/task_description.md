# GLM-5-FP8 Decode Latency Optimization

Optimize the decode latency of the GLM-5-FP8 model on 8× AMD MI355X GPUs using SGLang.

## Environment

- **Installed SGLang runtime**: `/sgl-workspace/sglang/` — on `sys.path`, used by `python3 -m sglang.*`. **Edit files HERE to modify SGLang behavior.**
- **SGLang reference checkout**: `/workspace/sglang/` — fresh `git clone` for reference only. Changes here do NOT affect the runtime.
- **Model weights**: `zai-org/GLM-5-FP8` cached at `/root/.cache/huggingface`.
- **Benchmark script**: `/workspace/bench_glm5.sh` — runs `sglang.bench_one_batch` with fixed workload params.

## Benchmark

The benchmark runs `sglang.bench_one_batch` and prints:
  `Decode median (ms): <value> | tp=8 batch=1`

First run takes ~25 minutes (model loading + CUDA graph compilation).
Set `timeout: 1800` when running it. If it times out, kill leftover sglang processes
(`ps aux | grep sglang | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9`) before retrying.

`bench_one_batch` supports backend selection flags such as `--attention-backend`,
`--decode-attention-backend`, `--fp8-gemm-backend`, etc. The benchmark script uses
defaults. To experiment with backends, modify the runtime source code or configuration
rather than the benchmark script.

Read the benchmark output logs carefully to identify which backends are active (attention,
MoE, all-reduce) before optimizing. Only optimize backends that are actually in use.

## Rules

- Do NOT use `pkill -f` — it kills your own shell. Use targeted `kill <PID>`.
- Read error messages carefully and fix the root cause.
- Final metrics must use CUDA graphs (no `--disable-cuda-graph`).
- Run `bench_glm5.sh` as your LAST command.
